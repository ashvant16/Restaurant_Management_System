With the help of this Python program, we intend to:
•	Streamline restaurant operations by computerizing the various functions of a restaurant 
•	Offer two different logins:
  - one for the customer and the other for the restaurant
•	Help customers reserve tables with ease 
  - Allow changing of reservation details 
  - Allow cancellation of reservation
•	Allow customers to order food 
	- Preview of menu is provided
  -	Allow changing of order before billing 
  -	Calculate the bill of a customer after he/she has placed their order
•	Allow the restaurant to view all reservations and feedback of customers
